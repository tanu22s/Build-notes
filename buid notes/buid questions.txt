Q.	What is servlet lifecycle.? 

 	init()

{{  Q.	Difference between generic servelt and http servlet.? 

 	GenericServlet  defines a generic and protocol (set of rules) independent servlet. it implements Servlet interface that  

        has lifecycle methods of a servlet. 

HttpServlet defines an HTTP protocol specific servlet. it inherits the GenericServlet class.  

HttpServlet provides service methods such as doGet() and doPost() for handling HTTP specific services.    }} 

 

Q.	Differentiate between GET and POST? 

 

<.> In doGet Form submitted is encoded in URL but not in doPost. 

<.> Since data is sent through URL therefore its request size(Parameter size less than 2KB)  

    is restricted But there is no restriction in doPost(). 

<.> doGet is unsecure because its Parameter remains in browser history but doPost is secure. 

<.> doGet Contains only character but in doPost it also contains binary data. 

<.> doGet can be cached and can be bookmarked but in doPost it cannot be cached and bookmarked.  

 

Q.	doGet & doPost??? submit and view logic 

 

{{ Q.	When run for service method.?

Q.	Show methods of servlet which you have Extended?  

HTTPSERVLET 		:- It inherit GenericServlet class, It is a base class of all servlets that handles HTTP requests. 

ITS METHODS ARE		:- doGet(), doPost(), doPut(), doHead(), doDelete()  

   (ALSO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN ITS doGet &doPost methods) 

 

{{  Q.	Difference between forword and send redirect.? 

Method forward() of request dispatcher object is used to forward request from one servlet to another servlet. 

Method sendRedirect of request dispatcher object is used to generate new request always and sent to another servlet.   }} 

 

{{  Q.  how to enable session?

{{  Q.  Difference between session(true) and session(false);	 

 

HttpSession session = request.getSession();  //false 

if any session is existed in application it will get it; otherwise it will create new session.	 

 

HttpSession session = request.getSession(true); 

it always create new session.                           }}

 	By using session Tracking.            }} 

 

Q.	Who called service()? 

Container. 

 

Q.	Who is calling validate()?  

SERVICE() & IT IS CALLED BY CONTAINER & CONTAINER IS CALLED BY JVM. 

 

Q.	 How you can check  that user logged in or not?? && And when does user State will show null?? 

 On Header we are checking through session the status of user is null or not. OR we can also check it by session ID. 

 

Q.	 Why did not we use request scope for logging instead of session? 

 Because if we do so then on every request of user we have to authenticate user login id and password. 

 

Q.	 Why devlopers are not recommended to override service method give reason? 

 Bcz it change the original defination of service(). 

(Eg.To perform generic operation provided by devloper.Bcz it call goGet() by default.) 

 

Q.	 How a client can communicate to  server? 

 Using protocols. we used Http.

======================== 

{{ Q.	How can you achieve data abstration ? 

   	Data Abstraction is process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality.

{{ Q.	How can you achieve full abstration in your application ? 

 	by using interface.   }} 

 

{{ Q.	 What is Abstract Class ? 

 Abstract class is used when parent need to provide default behavior along with abstract method.
