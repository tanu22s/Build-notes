\ 

 

16. Defference between comparable and comparator.? 

Ans..Comparable	               Comparator 

1) Comparable provides single sorting sequence. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of single element  

   such as id or name or price etc.	                     

   Comparator provides multiple sorting sequence. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements  

   such as id, name and price etc. 

 

2) Comparable affects the original class i.e. actual class is modified.	 

            Comparator doesn't affect the original class i.e. actual class is not modified. 

 

3) Comparable provides compareTo() method to sort elements.	                 

                   Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements. 

 

4) Comparable is found in java.lang package.	 

      Comparator is found in java.util package. 

 

5) We can sort the list elements of Comparable type by Collections.sort(List) method. 

           We can sort the list elements of Comparator type by collections.sort(List,Comparator) method 

 

17.	Defference between generic servelt and http servlet.? 

Ans..GENERICSERVLET	     HTTPSERVLET 

1.) Can be used with any protocol (means, can handle any protocol). Protocol independent.-- 

Should be used with HTTP protocol only (can handle HTTP specific protocols) . Protocol dependent. 

 

2.) All methods are concrete except service() method. service() method is abstract method.	 

All methods are concrete (non-abstract). service() is non-abstract method. 

 

3.) service() should be overridden being abstract in super interface. 

service() method need not be overridden. 

 

4.) It is a must to use service() method as it is a callback method. 

Being service() is non-abstract, it can be replaced by doGet() or doPost() methods. 

 

5.) Extends Object and implements interfaces Servlet, ServletConfig and Serializable.	 

Extends GenericServlet and implements interface Serializable 

 

6.) Direct subclass of Servet interface.	 

Direct subclass of GenericServlet. 

 

7.) Defined javax.servlet package.	Defined javax.servlet.http package.

All the classes and interfaces present in javax.servlet.http package are protocol dependent (specific to HTTP). 

 

18.	Defference between forword and send redirect.? 

Ans..    forward is used to forward request from one page to another with in the same applicaltion  

 

where as sendRedirect is used to forward request between multiple applications or servers  

 

same request is forwarded to another page where as new request is generated to forward via reDirect() 

 

called over the object of RequestDispatcher Where as reDirect is called over the object of session. 

 

redirect is slow as compared to forward() as it needs to genetate a new request to forward.
